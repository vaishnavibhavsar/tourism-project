HISTORY: Built in 1570, the tomb is of particular cultural significance as it was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent.
	 Defying the popular principle, Humayun’s Tomb was actually built by a wife, Hamida Banu Begum, for her husband, Mughal Emperor Humayun. 
	 This was built by her in the fond memory of her loving husband after his demise. After Emperor Humayun’s death, she called the Persian 
	 architects and told them to create something so fabulous that the world remembers it for ages to come
