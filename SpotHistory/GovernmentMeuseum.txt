	 assigned the grounds to a committee of 24 which then regulated the public amusements in the city.In 1821, the committee sold the main house 
	 and central garden space to E. S. Moorat, an Armenian merchant who, in turn, sold it back to the government in 1830. 
         The government first used the buildings and the grounds as the collector's "Cutcherry" and later for the "Central Museum."
	 The museum was originally established in a building on College Road in Nungambakkam in the year 1851 and was shifted to the present site in 1854.
