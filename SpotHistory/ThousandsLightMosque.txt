SPECIALITY: Thousand Lights Mosque is a prominent place of worship of the Muslim Shia community.

HISTORY:   *The foundation of the Thousand Lights Mosque was laid by Nawab Umdat-ul-Umrah of Wallajah dynasty, the ruler of 
	    the Carnatic State under the Mughal Empire in the end 1700's and early 1800s. 
	   *His real name was Ghulam Hussain Ali Khan, but Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II later awarded him the title. 
                   *This happened because of the intervention of Robert Clive, thanks to their family's staunch support to the British East India Company. 
                   *This gave the Nawab a strong foothold in the Carnatic areas during the rise of the British and subsequent fall of 
	    almost every other independent empire.
